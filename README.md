# VideoGame
# Wrote a user-interaction game in Python.

Implemented buttons and mouse-clicking features for user 
to be able to move left and right, and jump to dodge spawning 
enemies. Created buttons representing different levels, as well 
as a restart button.

The purpose of this program is to create a game 
that allows the user to move a character away and 
towards objects and collect them. I have allowed the 
player to jump with the space bar is presssed. The 
player is given three lives but will die instantly
if hit by a babyshrek. There is also a score for the 
player. Every time a cheese is collected, the score
increases by one. I have also added different levels k
and a restart button. Instructions are located on the 
left side along with the buttons for the different 
levels and for restarting. The game starts on 
level one.
